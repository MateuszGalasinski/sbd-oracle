## How to get oracle image ? 
You need an account on Oracle to pull any oracle image. Dockerhub access had been uncooperative, so you need to use container-registry.oracle.com.
Once you have an account, run
 `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`  
and specify credentials used to create account on oracle.
